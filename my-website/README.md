# Deliverables

On Friday, we will be having a feedback session on your progress on the personal portfolio project. By then we expect to see:

* An updated README.md file. A readme is like the cover to the book of code you've written for this site. Don't publish a book without a cover! Describe this project in a few sentences - what are you trying to achieve with this page, what technologies are you using, etc. [This is a decent template](https://gist.github.com/zenorocha/4526327) for the way that a readme often looks. Make sure to link to the live site and include some sort of image (logo or screenshot). If you need help writing markdown language (the reason the file ends in `.md`), check out [this guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
* A "My work" section of the page that includes (or will include) links to all repos that contain homework deliverables.
* A "Contact me" section of the page that includes (at least) a way to email you, a link to your GitHub profile, and a link to your LinkedIn profile.
* Some custom HTML, CSS, JS, and images. Put your own personal flare on the page and add some customizations. These could be really simple changes that add a bit of your aesthetic or they could be larger features like a navbar, a footer, a photo carousel, bootstrap integration, event listeners, or CSS animations. [Google for personal websites](https://www.google.com/search?q=personal+website&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=612&site=webhp&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx-Krl6bfOAhUUI2MKHaoPDUEQsAQIQA&dpr=2#imgrc=OOkEvdqZczSU-M%3A), find one that you like, and imitate it!

We're really looking forward to seeing what you've built by Friday! Please reach out to your peers or instructors if you need help making progress on this project.




future integrations and ideas. I'M JUST SPITBALLIN HERE...

(A+) Fix header to top.

(A) I want to auto scroll down the page when you click on the <a href> links.

(A-) Need to update format of resume. Reduce amount of html and use more css spacing.

(B+) As you scroll down the page, I want the fixed header to replace the corresponding <a href> to a home <a href> button that will force scroll to the top. The transition between <a href> will be a flip(rotate on z axis) to show the new <a href>.

(B)want to include a download link of my resume.

(B-)Want to complete an actual easy form in the contact section.

(B-) include icons with the different <a href> pages.
