      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey, I'm Kyle.</p>
      <p>I have three first names. I'm a twenty-six year old SFSU graduate originally from Laguna Beach...and yes, Kristen and Lauren went to my high school while I was there. I knew you were thinking it.</p>
      <p>Nowadays I am a recruiter for a Fintech start-up here in the city and have been with the company since I was brought on immediately post grad.</p>
      <p>My whole family is from Massachussetts so I've been raised to worship the Patriots and the Red Sox. I follow both teams religiously. #freebrady</p>
      <p>I've read way too many Star Wars books, own an original VHS box set, and have a Stormtrooper and Boba Fett. Speaking of tattoos, I have another of a coffin I spontaneously got with my girlfriend on a random Friday the 13th from a flash sheet which I paid a whoppin' $13 for.</p>
      <p>My parents live on a boat, so it's safe to say I enjoy spending any time I have away from the city on the water. I one day want to own my own boat and have the luxury of going out to sail at my leisure and hopefully be able to catch some fresh sushi while doing so!</p>
