## Executing your code
There are a number of options for running/executing your code. They all have their uses, so we encourage you to learn all of them:

- From the browser:
    - **Using the [Chrome Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/console/console-ui?hl=en#opening-the-console)**
        * Tip: Use `↑` and `↓` to cycle through your code history. Pressing `→` selects the current suggestion. If there’s a single suggestion, `Tab` to select it.
    + **Using [Javascript Snippets](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/snippets/)** to execute and save your scripts.
- From the command line:
    + **Using the [Node REPL / Shell](http://www.nodelabs.org/repl.html)**
        * Tip: Type `.exit` to quit. Use `↑` and `↓` to cycle through your code history.
    + **Using the [`node some-file.js` command](http://javascript.cs.lmu.edu/notes/commandlinejs/)**
        * Tip: Use `ctrl` + `c` (shortcut) to quit "hanging" programs. And make sure to `console.log("your output")`.
