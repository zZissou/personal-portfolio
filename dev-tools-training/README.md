# Devtools and debugging training

### Introduction

> ***Note:*** *This can be a pair programming activity or done independently.*

Fork and clone this repository!

The code in scripts/app.js has comments that list some problems with the sample project website. There are currently some bugs, but it should look like this:

As it stands, the `console.log("Sanity Check: JS is working!");` isn't even showing up! What might be the problem there?

Recognize that this code previews some work we'll be doing today and tomorrow with JQuery. You don't need to understand all of the syntax to read the error messages and begin to correct the problems.

Update the project code to fix the problems described in the comments. Note: the last one (alerting 0-4) is a stretch.
